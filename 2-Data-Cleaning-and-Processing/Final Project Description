This repository contains my final project for Course 2, Data Cleaning & Processing with Copilot in Excel, of the Microsoft Excel Skills Professional Certificate (Coursera).
For the final project, I worked with a global mobility company dataset to simulate real-world sales analysis. 
The project focused on cleaning, organizing, and preparing messy datasets for accurate reporting and actionable insights.

Key tasks and techniques:

Data cleaning & standardization:

  -Identified and removed duplicate records using Copilot.

  -Standardized currency formats into a single unit and rounded values for consistency.

  -Converted units of measurement (e.g., speed, weight) into uniform standards.

  -Imputed missing values by applying logical rules based on dataset patterns.

Data transformation & structuring:

  -Split full addresses into street, city, postal code and expanded country codes into full names.

  -Grouped countries into continents for regional analysis.

  -Combined first and last names into full names for readability.

  -Created custom columns for ranges (minâ€“max values) and total sales (including discounts/refunds).

Formatting & presentation:

  -Applied conditional formatting to highlight key sales patterns.

  -Improved readability through alignment, clean headers, and uniform presentation.

Data analysis & insights:

  Built PivotTables to analyze:

  -Sales by region, month, and quarter.

  -Top-performing product categories and sales reps.

  -Lowest performers and underperforming regions.

  -Revenue vs. expenses for profitability trends.

  -Summarized total sales across product types and geographies.
