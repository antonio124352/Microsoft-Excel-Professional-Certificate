This repository contains my final project for Course 3, Advanced Data Analysis & Visualization with Copilot in Excel, of the Microsoft Excel Skills Professional Certificate (Coursera).
For the final project I worked with a global sports equipment retailer dataset to evaluate sales performance, uncover trends, and deliver a data-driven report. 
The project emphasized advanced analysis, PivotTables, and effective visual storytelling.

Key tasks and techniques:

  -Data organization & preparation

  -Sorted and filtered data by product, region, and sales rep for targeted insights.

  -Created new calculated fields (mean, median, standard deviation) to summarize performance.

  -Categorized values into thresholds (Low, Average, High) for easier performance assessment.

Statistical & advanced analysis:

  -Performed covariance and correlation analysis to evaluate relationships (e.g., price vs. sales).

  -Retrieved and aggregated quarterly and category-level sales data.

  -Calculated key performance metrics (totals, averages, counts) to benchmark business units.

Data visualization with Copilot:

  -Built multiple chart types (line, bar, pie, clustered bar) to highlight sales trends and category comparisons.

  -Generated PivotTables and PivotCharts to analyze:

    Sales by region, product, and quarter.

    Top- and bottom-performing sales reps.

    Discount impact on revenue and profitability.

  -Enhanced PivotCharts with slicers, filters, timelines, and drill-downs for interactive analysis.

Report creation & storytelling:

  -Compiled findings into a sales performance report, combining visualizations, summaries, and recommendations.

  -Identified three key improvement areas to guide strategic decisions.

  -Optimized layout and design for clarity, accessibility, and executive readability.
