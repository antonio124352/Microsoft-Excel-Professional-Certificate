For the capstone project of the Microsoft Excel Professional Certificate, I built an event management and forecasting dashboard for the Tech Innovators Summit. This project combined Excel Copilot, 
VBA macros, forecasting functions, and scenario planning to deliver an interactive, automated, and professional-grade solution.

Key tasks and techniques:

  -Dataset creation & preparation:

    -Constructed a 100-row dataset with attendee details, ticket categories, marketing spend, and event costs.

    -Ensured structured, consistent data to support reliable analysis and forecasting.

UserForm design with VBA:

  -Built a custom Attendee Management UserForm using ActiveX controls:

    -TextBoxes (ID, name, email, registration date)

    -ComboBox (ticket type, session preferences)

    -RadioButtons (online vs. in-person attendance)

    -ListBox (dietary preferences)

    -Buttons (Submit, Fetch, Update, Cancel)

  -Wrote VBA code for data submission, retrieval, and updates, with comments for readability.

Forecasting & financial modeling:

  -Applied =FORECAST.ETS() and the Forecast Sheet to predict future attendance and ticket sales.

  -Created projections for attendance, ticket revenue, and costs on a Projections sheet.

  -Used Goal Seek to calculate ticket price and attendance levels required to hit profit targets.

Interactive dashboard development:

  -Designed a professional Event Dashboard with:

    -Key KPIs: total attendees, revenue, profit.

    -Visuals: revenue by session (bar), attendee trends (line), online vs. in-person (pie).

    -Slicers (attendance type, session preferences) and timeline filters for interactivity.

  -Enhanced usability with dynamic updates via macros (Refresh Dashboard button).

Scenario planning (Budget Challenge):

  -Duplicated and modified dashboard for updated financial goals (marketing spend, operational costs, profit target).

  -Used Goal Seek to simulate new pricing and attendance requirements.

  -Clearly labeled version as Budget Challenge Scenario, preserving interactivity and automation.
